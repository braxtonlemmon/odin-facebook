# Project: Building Facebook
Capstone Ruby on Rails project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/final-project). The objective is to create a social network site that is similar to Facebook. Users will be able to do the following:
- create a new profile
- edit the profile as desired
- make and accept friend requests
- create text and photo posts
- view a news feed of uploaded posts from friends
- "like" posts
- sign-in via Facebook (using Omniauth and Devise)

# Concepts/technologies I practiced using:
- modeling data
- using Postgresql
- Omniauth
- MVC design pattern
- TDD with RSpec
- Devise
